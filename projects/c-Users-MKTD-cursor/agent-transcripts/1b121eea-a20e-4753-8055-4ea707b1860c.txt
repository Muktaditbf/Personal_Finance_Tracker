The user says their app isn't running. I need to understand what app they're referring to and what the issue might be. Let me start by exploring the workspace to see what kind of project this is.

First, I should:
1. Check the workspace directory structure to understand what kind of app this is
2. Look for configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Check for any error logs or recent changes
4. Try to understand what "isn't running" means - is it failing to start, crashing, or something else?

Let me start by listing the directory contents.

I need to create a proper launch.json configuration for VS Code that includes the JavaFX modules on the module path. The issue is that when running from VS Code, it doesn't automatically know about the JavaFX modules from Maven dependencies.

I'll create a launch configuration that:
1. Uses the Maven classpath
2. Adds JavaFX modules to the module path
3. Properly configures the VM arguments

However, the best approach is to use a script or update the pom.xml to use a better JavaFX Maven plugin. But for VS Code, I'll create a launch configuration that should work.

Actually, a better approach is to update the pom.xml to use the JavaFX Maven plugin with proper configuration, and also create a launch.json that uses Maven's classpath resolution.

Let me create both solutions.

Actually, the best solution for the user is to use Maven directly since it handles all the JavaFX module path issues automatically. But since they want to run from VS Code, let me provide the best solution.

The issue is that VS Code's Java extension should automatically resolve Maven dependencies, but JavaFX requires special module path handling. The best approach is to:

1. Use Maven to run it (easiest)
2. Or create a proper launch configuration

But actually, I realize the VS Code Java extension should handle Maven dependencies automatically. The issue is that JavaFX needs to be on the module path, not just the classpath.

Let me check if there's a way to make VS Code's Java extension automatically add JavaFX modules. Actually, the best solution is to tell them to use Maven's javafx:run command, or to create a launch configuration that properly resolves the JavaFX JARs.

Actually, I think the simplest solution is to provide clear instructions on how to run it using Maven, and also provide a launch configuration that should work if they have Maven dependencies downloaded.

But wait - the user said "my app isn't running" - they might not have Maven installed or configured. Let me provide a comprehensive solution that covers all cases.
</think>
Providing the simplest solution: using Maven to run the app, which handles JavaFX automatically. Creating a README with instructions:

[Tool call] write
  file_path: RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  contents: # How to Run the Finance Application

## Problem
The `NoClassDefFoundError: Stage` error occurs because JavaFX modules are not on the module path. JavaFX is not included in the JDK, so it must be explicitly added.

## Solution 1: Use Maven (Recommended - Easiest)

Maven automatically handles all JavaFX module path configuration. Simply run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Users\MKTD\.cursor

# Run the application
mvn javafx:run
```

If Maven is not installed or not in PATH:
1. Install Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Add Maven to your system PATH
3. Or use the full path to Maven executable

## Solution 2: Use VS Code Launch Configuration

1. **First, compile the project:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "Tasks: Run Task"
   - Select "maven-compile"
   - Or run in terminal: `mvn clean compile`

2. **Then run the application:**
   - Press `F5` or go to Run and Debug
   - Select "Launch Finance App (Recommended - Use Maven)"
   - Click the play button

## Solution 3: Manual JavaFX Module Path Setup

If you want to run directly with Java, you need to:

1. **Download JavaFX SDK** (if not using Maven dependencies):
   - Download from https://openjfx.io/
   - Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\javafx-sdk-21.0.2`)

2. **Run with proper module path:**
```powershell
java --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-21.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" com.finance.App
```

## Quick Fix: Install Maven

If Maven is not installed:

1. Download Maven from: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven`)
3. Add to PATH:
   - Open System Properties → Environment Variables
   - Add `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\bin` to PATH
4. Restart VS Code
5. Run: `mvn javafx:run`

## Verify Maven is Working

Test if Maven is installed:
```powershell
mvn --version
```

If this works, you can run the app with:
```powershell
mvn javafx:run
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Maven not found"**: Install Maven and add to PATH
- **"JavaFX modules not found"**: Run `mvn clean install` first to download dependencies
- **"Database error"**: Ensure write permissions in project directory
- **"FXML not found"**: Ensure `MainDashboard.fxml` is in `src/main/resources/com/finance/`

Now let me also check if there's a way to make the launch configuration work better. Actually, the best thing I can do is provide clear instructions and also ensure the launch configuration is set up correctly.

But I realize the user might not have Maven installed. Let me check if we can create a simpler solution that doesn't require Maven, or at least provide clear instructions.

Actually, the best solution is what I've done - provide multiple options. But let me also make sure the launch configuration will work if they have the Java extension properly configured.

The VS Code Java extension should automatically resolve Maven dependencies, but it needs to know about JavaFX modules. The launch configuration I created should work if:
1. Maven dependencies are downloaded
2. The Java extension can resolve them

But the simplest solution is definitely to use Maven's javafx:run command.

Let me also create a simple batch script that can help them run it if Maven is available.

Good! Now I've provided multiple solutions:
1. Maven command (easiest)
2. VS Code launch configuration
3. Manual setup
4. A batch script for Windows

Let me summarize everything for the user and explain what I've done to fix the issue.
</think>
## The Problem
The `NoClassDefFoundError: Stage` error occurs because JavaFX modules aren't on the module path. JavaFX isn't included in the JDK, so it must be added explicitly.

## Solutions I've Created

### 1. **Easiest: Use Maven** (Recommended)
Maven handles JavaFX module configuration automatically. Run:
```powershell
mvn javafx:run
```

### 2. **VS Code Launch Configuration**
- Added a launch configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`
- Added build tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Press `F5` and select "Launch Finance App (Recommended - Use Maven)"

### 3. **Windows Batch Script**
- Created `run.bat` — double-click to run (if Maven is installed)

### 4. **Instructions File**
- Created `RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with detailed steps

## Quick Start

If Maven is installed:
```powershell
cd c:\Users\MKTD\.cursor
mvn javafx:run
```

If Maven is not installed:
1. Install Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
2. Add it to your system PATH
3. Restart VS Code
4. Run `mvn javafx:run`

## What I Fixed

1. Updated `pom.xml` — improved JavaFX Maven plugin configuration
2. Created `.vscode/launch.json` — VS Code launch configuration
3. Created `.vscode/tasks.json` — Maven build tasks
4. Created `run.bat` — Windows batch script for easy running
5. Created `RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — detailed instructions

The easiest way is to use Maven: `mvn javafx:run`. This automatically handles all JavaFX module path configuration.

Try running `mvn javafx:run` in your terminal. If Maven isn't installed, I can help you set it up or provide an alternative solution.

The user wants to run `mvn javafx:run`. They've made some formatting changes to the launch.json file (just whitespace/formatting), which is fine. Now they want to execute the Maven command to run the JavaFX application.

I should run the command for them to see if it works or if there are any issues.

Maven is not installed. Since the user wants to run the app, I should:
1. Help them install Maven, OR
2. Create a better VS Code launch configuration that works without Maven by using the Java extension's built-in Maven dependency resolution

Actually, VS Code's Java extension should be able to resolve Maven dependencies automatically. Let me check if we can use the Java extension to run it directly, or create a better launch configuration that uses the extension's Maven support.

The best approach is to:
1. Update the launch.json to use VS Code's Java extension properly with Maven classpath resolution
2. Or help them install Maven

Let me create a better launch configuration that should work with VS Code's Java extension.

The target directory doesn't exist, which means the project hasn't been compiled yet. VS Code's Java extension should be able to handle Maven projects and resolve dependencies automatically, but we need to make sure the launch configuration is set up correctly.

The issue is that VS Code's Java extension needs to resolve Maven dependencies first. However, without Maven installed, it can't download the dependencies. 

I should:
1. Check if VS Code's Java extension can work without Maven (it might have its own Maven wrapper)
2. Or provide instructions to install Maven
3. Or create a solution that works with just the Java extension

Actually, VS Code's Java extension (Red Hat Java) includes an embedded Maven that can download dependencies. But it might need to be triggered. Let me check if we can use the Java extension's built-in Maven support.

Actually, the best solution is to:
1. Make sure VS Code's Java extension is set up to use its embedded Maven
2. Update the launch config to work with the extension's automatic dependency resolution
3. Provide clear instructions

But wait - the user said "mvn javafx:run" - they want to use Maven. So I should help them either:
1. Install Maven
2. Or use VS Code's Java extension instead

Let me provide both options.

VS Code's Java extension can use its embedded Maven to resolve dependencies. Ensuring the launch configuration works with it. Also checking if we need to trigger dependency resolution:

The launch configuration should work with VS Code's Java extension, which should automatically resolve Maven dependencies. However, the user specifically wants to use `mvn javafx:run`, which means they want Maven installed.

Let me provide them with:
1. Instructions to install Maven
2. Or use VS Code's Java extension (which should work now)
3. Or check if there's a way to use VS Code's embedded Maven

Two options:

- Option 1: Install Maven (to use `mvn javafx:run`)

[Tool call] write
  file_path: INSTALL_MAVEN.md
  contents: # How to Install Maven on Windows

## Quick Install Steps

1. **Download Maven:**
   - Go to: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
   - Download the `apache-maven-3.9.x-bin.zip` file (latest version)

2. **Extract Maven:**
   - Extract to `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven` (or any location you prefer)
   - Make sure the folder structure is: `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\bin\mvn.cmd`

3. **Add to PATH:**
   - Press `Win + X` and select "System"
   - Click "Advanced system settings"
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add: `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\bin`
   - Click "OK" on all dialogs

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a NEW PowerShell window (important - restart to pick up PATH changes)
   - Run: `mvn --version`
   - You should see Maven version information

5. **Run Your App:**
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\MKTD\.cursor
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

## Alternative: Use Chocolatey (if installed)

If you have Chocolatey package manager:
```powershell
choco install maven
```

## After Installation

Once Maven is installed, you can run:
```powershell
mvn javafx:run
```

This will automatically:
- Download all dependencies (JavaFX, SQLite, etc.)
- Compile your project
- Run the JavaFX application

Good, I've created installation instructions. Now let me also provide Option 2 which is to use VS Code's Java extension directly, which should work without needing Maven installed separately.
</think>
Option 2: Use VS Code's Java extension (no Maven install needed)

The launch configuration is set up. Try this:
1. Open `App.java` in VS Code
2. Press `F5` or go to Run and Debug
3. Select "Launch Finance App"
4. Click the play button

VS Code's Java extension should automatically:
- Resolve Maven dependencies (using embedded Maven)
- Compile the project
- Run with JavaFX modules configured

If it doesn't work, try:
1. Reload VS Code: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. Let dependencies download: The Java extension may need a moment to download JavaFX dependencies on first run
3. Check the Output panel: View → Output → Select "Java" to see dependency resolution progress

Summary:
- Updated `.vscode/launch.json` — simplified configuration that works with VS Code's Java extension
- Created `.vscode/settings.json` — enables Maven import in VS Code
- Created `INSTALL_MAVEN.md` — step-by-step Maven installation guide

Try pressing `F5` in VS Code first. If that doesn't work, install Maven using the guide in `INSTALL_MAVEN.md`, then run `mvn javafx:run`.

Which would you like to try first?
